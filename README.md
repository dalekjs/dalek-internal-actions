## Docs

This module is used internally by [DalekJS](//github.com/dalekjs/dalek).
I can not think of a situation where this module is helpful in other ways then
beeing pulled down & loaded by Dalek. But hey, surprise me.

For Dalek, this is the module that defines all the methods that can execute some
action in the browser. The methods are be part of the test object that dalek injects
into the user tests.

If you wonder what actions are:
> Actions are a way to control your browsers, e.g. simulate user interactions like clicking elements, open urls, filling out input fields, etc.
